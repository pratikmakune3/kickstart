KickstartCoin - Decentralized kickstarter.com using Ethereum Blockchain Ecosystem (Solidity, Web3.js, IPFS), React.js, Node.js, Next.js.

Decentralized Kickstarter - the dApp which is trying to mitigate the scam problems, startups like Kickstarter face. 
Contributors donate money to campaign they believe in, once the money goes in, they have no control over where the contributed money goes, malicious campaign managers might end up making scams. 
KickstartCoin addresses this problem and solves it using Smart Contract. It's still in evolving phase, in process for opensource.

Written Smart Contract in Solidity, tested in Remix Ethereum IDE, wrote test cases using mocha.js. Created frontend in React.js, used Web3.js to interact with Ethereum side of application deployed on Rinkeby testnet.

The application is hosted on heroku : https://kickstartcoin.herokuapp.com/
